**Note**: To implement the snake animation and the recent activity feed, you need to set up GitHub Actions.

### Snake Animation Workflow

1. Create a `.github/workflows/snake.yml` file in your repository.
2. Add the following content to the `snake.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Generate Snake Animation

on:
  schedule: # execute every 12 hours
    - cron: "0 */12 * * *"
  push:
    branches:
    - master
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: Platane/snk@master
        id: snake-gif
        with:
          github_user_name: yourusername
          svg_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg

      - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v2.1.3
        with:
          target_branch: output
          build_dir: dist
